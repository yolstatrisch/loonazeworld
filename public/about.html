	<b>Loonazeworld</b> is a place where you can see almost everything about <b>LOONA</b>.
	This is clearly a WIP site and will probably stay as one so please bare that in mind.
	This site is partially inspired by Veeru's aggregate site that pretty much just like this one.
	You can visit their site <a href="http://loonaverse.github.io/">here</a> or to their public repository
	<a href="https://github.com/loonaverse/loonaverse.github.io">here</a>.
	<br><br>
	<b>Loonazeworld</b> is also hosted on a public repository so feel free to correct me if you see some
	mistakes I've made while making this site <a href="https://gitlab.com/y0l/loonazeworld">here</a>.
	<br><br>
	I'm not really good with words so I'll just end this about page. As always, <b>orbit LOONA</b> orbiters and
	don't forget to <a href="http://loona.stream/">stream Sonatine</a>.

	Thank You, yOl
