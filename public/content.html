		<b>Loonazeworld</b> is a place where you can see everything about <b>LOONA</b>.
		This is clearly a WIP site and will probably stay as one so please bare that in mind.
		This site is partially inspired by Veeru's aggregate site that pretty much just like this one.
		You can visit their site <a href="http://loonaverse.github.io/">here</a> or to their public repository
		<a href="https://github.com/loonaverse/loonaverse.github.io">here</a>.
		<br><br>
		<b>Loonazeworld</b> is also hosted on a public repository so feel free to correct me if you see some
		mistakes I've made while making this site <a href="https://gitlab.com/y0l/loonazeworld">here</a>.
		<br><br>
		I'm not really good with words so I'll just end this about page. As always, <b>orbit loona</b> orbiters and
		don't forget to <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6JmCdDs_GM">stream Sonatine</a></b>.
		<br><br>
		Thank You, yO|
